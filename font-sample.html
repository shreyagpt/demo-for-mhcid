<h1>A few of my favorite dogs:</h1>
  <p class="Titan One"> American Eskimos are one of the most loyal dogs ever. They love following you around, but often get lonely if attention is not given.</p>
  <p2 class="Quicksand"> Pomeranians are pretty awesome too. They usually come in many sizes, such as toy and medium. However, they can get really barky! Beware of the small dog syndrome.</p>
  <p3 class="Pacifico"> Corgis are also pretty cute. Notorious for their loaf-like appearance, corgis are very cute. Unfortunately, they can have severe back issues later in life.</p>
